# Road Accident Excel Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of road accident data using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provides a visual summary of key accident statistics, vehicle involvement, casualty severity, road types, and environmental conditions to help identify patterns and support decision-making for road safety initiatives.

The insights were derived from raw accident datasets which were thoroughly cleaned, structured, and visualized using Excel's features including pivot tables, slicers, charts, and conditional formatting.

## Tools & Techniques Used
Microsoft Excel (Advanced)

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

Slicers for Interactive Filtering

Conditional Formatting

Doughnut, Bar, and Line Charts

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before building the dashboard, significant preprocessing steps were taken:

Removed blank rows, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.

Converted data types (e.g., dates, categories).

Standardized naming conventions for clarity.

Created new columns for metrics like casualty severity types, vehicle types, light conditions, and road surface conditions.

Extracted year and month from date for time-based analysis.
